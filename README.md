# 🌍 Disaster Prediction & Relief Coordination System

A full-stack, machine learning–powered decision-support system designed to assist early disaster prediction and efficient relief coordination.

This project focuses on **engineering design, data modeling, and real-world workflows**, rather than just UI development.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Natural disasters require fast, data-driven decisions.  
This system integrates **machine learning predictions**, **relational databases**, and **role-based web services** to support:

- Early analysis of disaster severity and impact trends
- Real-time coordination of shelters, resources, and volunteers
- Clear information access for administrators, volunteers, and the public

The platform is designed as a **decision-support system**, not merely a visualization tool.
